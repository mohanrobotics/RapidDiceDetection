# RapidDiceDetection

The goal of this project is to design an automated dice detection system. This automated dice detection system
reports the position of each die being rolled and the values(number of pips) in it. It uses various computer vision
techniques and algorithm such as simple blob detection, hierarchical clustering, etc., were used to process the image
and detect the dice values and position from a particular region of interest(tray) of the image.

Libraries:
- openCv
- numpy
- scipy

Input:
Place the video inside the video directory
